> Forecasting with H2O AutoML

Modeltime H2O provides an H2O backend to the Modeltime Forecasting Ecosystem. The main algorithm is __H2O AutoML__, and automatic machine learning library that is built for speed and scale. 

``` r
# Install Development Version
devtools::install_github("business-science/modeltime.h2o")
```
## What's possible

With the Modeltime Ecosystem, it's easy to forecast at scale. This forecast was created with __H2O AutoML__. Try it out in [Getting Started with Modeltime H2O](https://business-science.github.io/modeltime.h2o/articles/getting-started.html). 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/h2o_forecast_plot.png")
```

## Meet the modeltime ecosystem 

> Learn a growing ecosystem of forecasting packages

```{r, echo=F, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', fig.cap="The modeltime ecosystem is growing"}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/modeltime_ecosystem.jpg")
```

Modeltime is part of a __growing ecosystem__ of Modeltime forecasting packages.

[_High-Performance Time Series Course_](https://university.business-science.io/p/ds4b-203-r-high-performance-time-series-forecasting/)

### Time Series is Changing

Time series is changing. __Businesses now need 10,000+ time series forecasts every day.__ This is what I call a _High-Performance Time Series Forecasting System (HPTSF)_ - Accurate, Robust, and Scalable Forecasting. 

 __High-Performance Forecasting Systems will save companies by improving accuracy and scalability.__ Imagine what will happen to your career if you can provide your organization a "High-Performance Time Series Forecasting System" (HPTSF System).

### How to Learn High-Performance Time Series Forecasting

I teach how to build a HPTFS System in my [__High-Performance Time Series Forecasting Course__](https://university.business-science.io/p/ds4b-203-r-high-performance-time-series-forecasting). You will learn:

- __Time Series Machine Learning__ (cutting-edge) with `Modeltime` - 30+ Models (Prophet, ARIMA, XGBoost, Random Forest, & many more)
- __Deep Learning__ with `GluonTS` (Competition Winners)
- __Time Series Preprocessing__, Noise Reduction, & Anomaly Detection
- __Feature engineering__ using lagged variables & external regressors
- __Hyperparameter Tuning__
- __Time series cross-validation__
- __Ensembling__ Multiple Machine Learning & Univariate Modeling Techniques (Competition Winner)
- __Scalable Forecasting__ - Forecast 1000+ time series in parallel
- and more.
