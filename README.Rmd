> Forecasting with H2O AutoML

Modeltime H2O provides an H2O backend to the Modeltime Forecasting Ecosystem. The main algorithm is __H2O AutoML__, and automatic machine learning library that is built for speed and scale. 

``` r
# Install Development Version
devtools::install_github("business-science/modeltime.h2o")
```
## What's possible

With the Modeltime Ecosystem, it's easy to forecast at scale. This forecast was created with __H2O AutoML__. Try it out in [Getting Started with Modeltime H2O](). 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/h2o_forecast.png")
```

## Meet the Forecasting Ecosystem 

Modeltime H2O is part of a __growing ecosystem__ of Modeltime forecasting packages.

[_My Talk on High-Performance Time Series Forecasting_](https://youtu.be/elQb4VzRINg)

### Time Series is Changing

Time series is changing. __Businesses now need 10,000+ time series forecasts every day.__ This is what I call a _High-Performance Time Series Forecasting System (HPTSF)_ - Accurate, Robust, and Scalable Forecasting. 

 __High-Performance Forecasting Systems will save companies MILLIONS of dollars.__ Imagine what will happen to your career if you can provide your organization a "High-Performance Time Series Forecasting System" (HPTSF System).

### How to Learn High-Performance Time Series Forecasting

I teach how to build a HPTFS System in my __High-Performance Time Series Forecasting Course__. If interested in learning Scalable High-Performance Forecasting Strategies then [take my Time Series Forecasting Course](https://university.business-science.io/p/ds4b-203-r-high-performance-time-series-forecasting). You will learn:
