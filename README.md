> Forecasting with H2O AutoML

Modeltime H2O provides an H2O backend to the Modeltime Forecasting
Ecosystem. The main algorithm is **H2O AutoML**, and automatic machine
learning library that is built for speed and scale.

``` r
# Install Development Version
devtools::install_github("business-science/modeltime.h2o")
```

## What’s possible

With the Modeltime Ecosystem, it’s easy to forecast at scale. This
forecast was created with **H2O AutoML**. Try it out in [Getting Started
with Modeltime
H2O](https://business-science.github.io/modeltime.h2o/articles/getting-started.html).

## Meet the Forecasting Ecosystem

Modeltime H2O is part of a **growing ecosystem** of Modeltime
forecasting packages.

[*My Talk on High-Performance Time Series
Forecasting*](https://youtu.be/elQb4VzRINg)

### Time Series is Changing

Time series is changing. **Businesses now need 10,000+ time series
forecasts every day.** This is what I call a *High-Performance Time
Series Forecasting System (HPTSF)* - Accurate, Robust, and Scalable
Forecasting.

**High-Performance Forecasting Systems will save companies MILLIONS of
dollars.** Imagine what will happen to your career if you can provide
your organization a “High-Performance Time Series Forecasting System”
(HPTSF System).

### How to Learn High-Performance Time Series Forecasting

I teach how to build a HPTFS System in my **High-Performance Time Series
Forecasting Course**. If interested in learning Scalable
High-Performance Forecasting Strategies then [take my Time Series
Forecasting
Course](https://university.business-science.io/p/ds4b-203-r-high-performance-time-series-forecasting).
You will learn:

-   **Time Series Machine Learning** (cutting-edge) with `Modeltime` -
    30+ Models (Prophet, ARIMA, XGBoost, Random Forest, & many more)
-   **Deep Learning** with `GluonTS` (Competition Winners)
-   **Time Series Preprocessing**, Noise Reduction, & Anomaly Detection
-   **Feature engineering** using lagged variables & external regressors
-   **Hyperparameter Tuning**
-   **Time series cross-validation**
-   **Ensembling** Multiple Machine Learning & Univariate Modeling
    Techniques (Competition Winner)
-   **Scalable Forecasting** - Forecast 1000+ time series in parallel
-   and more.
